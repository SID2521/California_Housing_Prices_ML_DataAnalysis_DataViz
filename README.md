# California_Housing_Prices_ML_DataAnalysis_DataViz
In my recent machine learning capstone project, I navigated the complexities of predicting California housing prices with a comprehensive approach. Integrating MySQL for efficient ETL processes, Python for data analysis, and Tableau for data visualization, the project showcased a seamless journey from data extraction to impactful visualizations. Leveraging key Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn, I explored and fine-tuned various models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. Through a meticulous process of training, validating, and testing on distinct datasets, Gradient Boosting emerged as the optimal model, delivering the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 49,343.55 on the test data. The project's success lies in the holistic integration of diverse tools and techniques, underscoring the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the dynamic field of machine learning. As I move forward, I am eager to delve into advanced techniques and further explore the synergies between Python, databases, and visualization tools, fostering continued growth in the realm of data science. Let's connect and explore opportunities for collaboration in this exciting journey! #MachineLearning #DataScience #ETL #Python #Tableau #CapstoneProject #GradientBoosting #HousingPrices #DataVisualization #LinkedInLearning #AI #MLModels #RootMeanSquaredError
